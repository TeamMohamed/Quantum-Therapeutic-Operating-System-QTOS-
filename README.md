🚀 Overview

Grow Your Own Cure - introduces the Quantum Therapeutic Operating System (QTOS) a first of its kind AI-powered, ECS-centered, cultivation-integrated medical OS designed to decentralize health, regenerate ecosystems, and personalize therapy down to the receptor level.

Built from 120+ timestamped therapeutic datasets**, 26 white papers, and 25+ natural compound libraries, QTOS generates precision healing protocols *and* enables patients, practitioners, and governments to grow their own medicine using terpene–fungi–plant synergies.

QTOS is not a health app.  
It’s the Master Control Room for Human Biology.


🧬 Core Features

- 🔹 **AI Protocol Generator** – Multi-omic input (ECS, PCD, miRNA, metabolism)  
- 🔹 **Grow-Your-Own Blueprint Engine** – Geo-climate-cultivation logic + ECS targeting  
- 🔹 **ECS Dashboards** – Real-time modulation of inflammation, tone, redox, neuroimmune  
- 🔹 **Companion Planting Intelligence** – Terpene-matched micro-ecosystem design  
- 🔹 **Clinical & Humanitarian Deployment Modes** – SaaS, Offline, Co-ops, National API
